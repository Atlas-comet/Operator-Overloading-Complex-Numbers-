# Operator-Overloading-Complex-Numbers-
ComplexNumbers using Operator overloading
In this Repo i create and use complex numbers in C++. so that it can hold the real and imaginary part of the complex number as member elements. There will be some member functions that are used to handle this class.
In this example i'm creating one complex type class, a function to display the complex number into correct format. Two additional methods to add and add two complex numbers and a non-complex number and also methods to compare two complex numbers
